# modal-comfyui

Run ComfyUI on Modal with auto-scaling, GPU snapshots, and easy model management.

Good for testing wan2.2 or other video generation models.

## Prerequisites

- A Modal account
- Python installed
- `uv` installed

## Installation

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the Modal client:
   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```
3. Set up your modal account (if not done already):
   ```bash
   modal setup
   ```

## Configuration

### Models

Edit `models.py` to manage your models. You can specify:
- Hugging Face models(`models`) using `repo_id` and `filename`.
- External models(`models_ext`, e.g. civitai) using a direct `url`.

Models are downloaded to volumes and symlinked to the specified `model_dir`.
See `models.py.example` for reference.

### Plugins and Custom Nodes

- **Plugins**: Edit `plugins.py` to add custom node IDs or titles to be installed via `comfy-cli`.
- **Workflow Dependencies**: If you have a `workflow_api.json` in the root directory, the setup will automatically install the necessary custom nodes for that workflow.

### In case of Insufficient Custom Node

Open ComfyUI manager on comfyui and click "Used in Workflow" to see which custom nodes are used in the workflow.

Add these custom nodes to `plugins.py`(be careful of node id).

## Usage

### Serve (Development)

Run the following command to start ComfyUI in development mode:
```bash
modal serve comfyui.py
```
This will provide a temporary URL where you can access the ComfyUI interface.

### Deploy (Production)

To deploy ComfyUI as a persistent app:
```bash
modal deploy comfyui.py
```

## Features

- **Auto-scaling**: Scales down to zero when not in use to save costs.
- **GPU Snapshots**: Fast startup times using Modal's GPU snapshots.
- **Model Caching**: Uses Modal Volumes to cache models across runs.
- **Custom Node Management**: Integrated with `comfy-cli` for easy plugin installation.
